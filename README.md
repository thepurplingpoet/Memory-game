Memory Game Project
===================

This project showcases a memory based game built using HTML, CSS and javascript. Dependencies include the font-awesome library which is used for the icons on the cards.

How to play:

There are 16 cards comprising of 8 card-pairs which have the same image on them. Clicking on any card reveals its image. Once clicked, the user can click on any other card. If the cards match, they stay revealed or else the image gets hidden.

The goal is to reveal all cards. At any time, the game can be reset by clicking on the restart icon. A timer and a star rating is also provided.
